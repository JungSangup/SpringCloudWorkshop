== Creating Service Instances

. The Fortune service stores the fortunes in a database. 
From the CLI, let's _create_ a free MySQL service instance:
+
----

$cf create-service p-mysql 100mb-dev fortune-db
Creating service instance fortune-db in org whewatt_org / space testing as whewatt@pivotal.io...
OK

----

. Next we'll create an instance of the config service.
+
----
$cf create-service p-config-server standard config-server
Creating service instance config-server in org whewatt_org / space testing as whewatt@pivotal.io...
OK
----

. Now, we need an instance of the service registry service.
+
----
$cf create-service p-service-registry standard service-registry
Creating service instance service-registry in org whewatt_org / space testing as whewatt@pivotal.io...
OK
----

. The final service that we need is for the circuit breaker.
----
$cf create-service p-circuit-breaker-dashboard standard circuit-breaker
Creating service instance circuit-breaker in org whewatt_org / space testing as whewatt@pivotal.io...
OK
----
