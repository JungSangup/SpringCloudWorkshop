== Creating Service Instances

. The Fortune service stores the fortunes in a database. 
From the CLI, let's _create_ a free MySQL service instance:
+
----

$cf create-service p-mysql 100mb-dev fortune-db
Creating service instance fortune-db in org whewatt_org / space testing as whewatt@pivotal.io...
OK

----

. Next we'll create an instance of the config service.
+
----
$cf create-service p-config-server standard config-server
Creating service instance config-server in org whewatt_org / space testing as whewatt@pivotal.io...
OK
----

. Now, we need an instance of the service registry service.
+
----
$cf create-service p-service-registry standard service-registry
Creating service instance service-registry in org whewatt_org / space testing as whewatt@pivotal.io...
OK
----

. The final service that we need is for the circuit breaker.
+
----
$cf create-service p-circuit-breaker-dashboard standard circuit-breaker
Creating service instance circuit-breaker in org whewatt_org / space testing as whewatt@pivotal.io...
OK
----

== TBD:  Need to described how to access the consoles to init the services.

== Push the applications

. Change to the directory that contains fortune-ui and fortune-teller-fortune-service.
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/session_05/lab_08/fortune-teller
----

. Open the manifest.yml file.  Notice the application names and the service bindings.

== Create a GitHub repository to Store Configuration

. Change to the lab directory:
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/session_05/lab_09/initial
----

. Create a directory for the configuration repo:
+
----
$ mkdir config-repo && cd config-repo
----

. Initialize the Git repository:
+
----
$ git init
----

. In the repo, create the file `ui.yml`, and into that file paste the following:
+
----
fortune-prefix: Howdy -
----

. Stage your changes and commit them:
+
----
git add . && git commit -m "initial commit"
----

. Make sure you're logged in to your GitHub account, and create a new repository:
+
image::../../../Common/images/github_1.png[]

. Give the repo a name and description, and then click ``Create repository'':
+
image::../../../Common/images/github_2.png[]

. Paste the commands from ``...push an existing repository...'' to the command prompt and execute them:
+
image::../../../Common/images/github_3.png[]
+
